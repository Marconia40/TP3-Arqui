# UART Module
## Overview

This repository contains a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) implementation in Verilog. The UART supports configurable data bits and baud rate, with a default configuration of 8 data bits and 19200 baud rate.
## Module Structure

The UART system consists of three main components integrated into a top-level module:

-   Baud Rate Generator (baudrate_gen.v)

        Generates a clock tick signal (s_tick) at 16 times the baud rate (oversampling)

        Configurable clock frequency and baud rate via parameters

        Default: 50 MHz system clock, 19200 baud rate

-   Receiver (rx_uart.v)

        Implements a UART receiver with state machine (IDLE, START, DATA, STOP)

        Samples input data at 16x the baud rate for reliable detection

        Outputs received data with a done tick signal

-   Transmitter (tx_uart.v)

        Implements a UART transmitter with state machine (IDLE, START, DATA, STOP)

        Transmits data at the configured baud rate

        Outputs a done tick signal when transmission completes

## Top-Level Module (UART.v)

-   Integrates all components

-   Provides clean interface with:

        Clock and reset inputs

        RX and TX data lines

        Control signals (transmit start)

        Status signals (receive/transmit done)

## Parameters

    DATA_BITS: Number of data bits (default: 8)

    CLK: System clock frequency (default in baudrate_gen: 50E6)

    BAUDRATE: Communication speed (default: 19200)

    TICKS: Oversampling rate (fixed at 16)

## Signals
### Inputs

-    i_clock: System clock

-    i_reset: Active-high reset

-    i_rx: Serial receive line

-    i_tx_data: Parallel data to transmit

-    i_tx_start: Signal to start transmission

### Outputs

-    o_rx_data: Received parallel data

-    o_rx_done_tick: Pulse when receive completes

-    o_tx: Serial transmit line

-    o_tx_done_tick: Pulse when transmit completes

## Usage

    Instantiate the UART module in your design

    Connect clock and reset signals

    For receiving:

        Monitor o_rx_done_tick for new data

        Read o_rx_data when done tick is high

    For transmitting:

        Apply data to i_tx_data

        Pulse i_tx_start high

        Wait for o_tx_done_tick before sending next byte

## Timing

    The module uses 16x oversampling for reliable data sampling

    Baud rate is derived from the system clock (default 50MHz â†’ 19200 baud)

    Timing is handled automatically by the baud rate generator

## Notes

    The UART uses standard format: 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit

    No parity bit is implemented

    The receiver detects start bits by monitoring for high-to-low transitions
